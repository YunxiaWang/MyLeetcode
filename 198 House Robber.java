/* Dynamic Programming
use a extra array maxToPos[] to store the maximum we could get after we leave each house i. 
The rationale is when the robber is at house i, to get the most money and with 100% safety, he/she either:
1.just robbed house i-2; robber will rob house i for sure, and with 100% safety! The max the robber could get is maxToPos[i-2]+num[i-1];
2.just robbed house i-1; the robber wonâ€™t rob the house, o/w would be caught by police. The max the robber could get is maxToPos[i-1];
